# Landing Page

See the finished product [here](https://dukeofjukes.github.io/odin-landing-page/).

Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) web development course. Given a reference photo, I structured and styled a landing page (loosely as a tribute to my cat, Bugg, hence the tuxedo cat photo).
